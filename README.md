# SpellBend-old
SpellBend as a Java Plugin
(However it turned out to be more of a LuckPerms + essentials remake)

Welcome to my first ever big Java project!
If you look around you will find horrible practicies not followed java conventions and all sorts of stuff that is just bad.
However I'm still proud of it and I love it.
Have fun browsing this, bye.
